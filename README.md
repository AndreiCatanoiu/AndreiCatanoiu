# 👋 Hi there! I'm Andrei

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a developer passionate about systems programming and backend development.  

My focus is on writing efficient code in **C**, **C++**, and **Java**, both for embedded systems and server-side applications.

I’m also comfortable working in Linux environments, having deployed and maintained my own cloud infrastructure for testing and MQTT data handling.

## 🧪 Projects

- **HomeGuard**  
  A smart home monitoring system built in Embedded C for ESP microcontrollers.  
  Integrates PIR motion sensors and MQ2 gas detectors, publishing real-time data over MQTT.  
  Focused on reliability, minimal latency, and easy integration with MQTT brokers.

- **andreicatanoiu.ro**  
  A Linux server hosted on AWS, configured via PuTTY for remote management.  
  Acts as a 24/7 MQTT broker and backend interface for sensor data transmission.  
  Used in production with HomeGuard for secure and low-latency device communication.

- **SecureHive**  
  Android application built in Java that subscribes to MQTT topics to display real-time alerts  
  from HomeGuard. Features a clean UI and Firebase integration for future enhancements  
  (e.g. user authentication, alert history, and remote control logic).
